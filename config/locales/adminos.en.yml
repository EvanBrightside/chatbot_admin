      title_html: General notes on adding and editing information
      hint1_html: "Everywhere, where it is possible to add this or that entity (for example, a page), <b>in the right upper part of the page there is a 'Add' button</b>."
      hint2_html: "Some types of records can be <b>published</b> (and will be displayed on the site) and <b>archived</b> (saved in the database, they can be edited, but they will not be published on the site). <b>The status of a published entry is indicated by <i class='icon-eye-open'></i> icon on the right side of the list</b> (the absence of an icon indicates that the entry has been archived)."
      hint3_html: "Some lists have the ability to <b>manually sort the records</b> (the order of display on the site and in the lists). Sometimes you want to bring some record before the previous one. This is true, for example, for a list of pages. <b>To move a record up or down, simply drag it to the desired place with the mouse pointer</b> (by pressing the left mouse button first, when the pointer is above <i class='icon-move'></i> icon)."
      hint4_html: "Some lists include <b>group operations</b> — publish, archive, and delete. To perform a group operation, you need to select the records with which the operation will be carried out - this can be done with checkboxes, and then selecting an operation from the list at the bottom of the page (click on the appropriate button). These operations can also be performed with individual objects in order not to enter the record editing page."
      hint5_html: "If <b>editing records</b> is available, <i class='icon-edit'></i> icon appears in the list. Clicking this icon opens the edit page for the corresponding entry."
      hint6_html: "All <b>specific page settings</b> are in '#{link_to I18n.t('admin.settings.actions.index.header'), edit_admin_settings_path}' section."
      hint7_html: "In cases where this is provided for page layout, the text fields are equipped with a <b>WYSIWYG editor</b>. The editor has the ability to post images and insert video code (embedded video) from the YouTube service."
